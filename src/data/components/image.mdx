### ImageComponent
The `ImageComponent` is a flexible React component for displaying images with additional features such as lazy loading, error handling, and captions.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- This component is designed to display images with support for lazy loading and error handling.
- The `role="img"` attribute on the main div provides semantic meaning to assistive technologies, identifying it as an image container.
- The `aria-label` is used to provide a textual alternative for screen readers.
- The `aria-busy` attribute indicates whether the image is currently being loaded.
- The component gracefully handles image loading errors by displaying a placeholder and a message.

#### Props
- `src`: **string**
  - The source URL of the image.
- `alt`: **string**
  - A text description of the image for accessibility purposes.
- `aspectRatio`: **string**
  - Optional. Used to specify the aspect ratio of the image container. Should be one of `aspect-auto`, `aspect-square` or `aspect-video`. Alternatively, you may use Tailwind's arbitrary values feature. Learn more [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio).
- `lazyLoad`: **boolean**
  - Optional. If true, the image will load lazily.
- `caption`: **string**
  - Optional. A caption that is displayed below the image.

#### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ImageComponent from './ImageComponent';

<ImageComponent
  src="image_url.jpg"
  alt="Descriptive text"
  aspectRatio="16:9"
  lazyLoad={true}
  caption="Image caption"
/>
