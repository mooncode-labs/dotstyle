### Toast Component
The `Toast` component is a notification pop-up used to provide feedback to users in response to their actions. It supports various configurations, including position, duration, and type of toast.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- This component displays a toast notification, which can be automatically triggered or toggled via a button.
- It allows custom content through the `children` prop and supports different types like success or error.
- The position of the toast (left, right, or center) can be specified, and it's animated based on this position.
- The toast disappears automatically after a specified duration, with the default being 3000 milliseconds.
- Accessibility features include `aria-live` and `role` attributes to ensure the toast notifications are accessible to screen readers.

#### Props
- `title`: **string**
  - The title displayed on the toast.
- `message`: **string**
  - A descriptive message shown on the toast.
- `children`: **ReactNode**
  - Custom content to be displayed below the message.
- `type`: **string**
  - The type of toast ('success', 'error' or default type), which affects its styling.
- `duration`: **number**
  - Duration in milliseconds for which the toast is visible.
- `position`: **string**
  - The position of the toast on the screen ('left', 'right', or default centered).
