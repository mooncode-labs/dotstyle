### Loader Component
The `Loader` component is a visually appealing and accessible indicator for loading processes in React applications. It is particularly useful for providing feedback during data fetching or long-running tasks.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- The loader displays an animated SVG icon alongside descriptive text to indicate an ongoing loading process.
- Accessibility features such as `aria-live="polite"` and `role="status"` ensure the component's changes are announced to screen readers appropriately.
- The `aria-label` attribute provides a meaningful description for screen readers, combining the provided title with a loading message.
- The component uses visually hidden text to enhance accessibility for screen reader users, without altering the visual UI.

#### Props
- `title`: **string** (for Loaders with Text)
  - Descriptive text displayed next to the loading animation, typically indicating what is being loaded.

#### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Loader from './Loader';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        // Simulate a loading process, e.g., data fetching
        setTimeout(() => {
            setIsLoaded(true);
        }, 2000); // 2 seconds delay
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            {isLoaded ? (
                <div>Content Loaded!</div>
            ) : (
                <Loader title="Loading Content" />
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

export default MyComponent;
