### Tooltip Component
The `Tooltip` component is a common UI element that provides additional information when a user hovers over or focuses on an element. It's particularly useful for enhancing user experience by providing context or explanations for interface elements without cluttering the UI.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- The component toggles the display of a tooltip based on user interactions like mouse hover and focus.
- The `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events control the visibility of the tooltip on hover, while `onFocus` and `onBlur` events manage its visibility during keyboard navigation.
- The tooltip is positioned absolutely relative to its parent and can be customized for different placements by changing the `left` and `top` Tailwind classes. The large tooltip makes use of cardUtil and textLabel. If customising and wanting the 'popup' animation to exist, please ensure you add `transition` and `duration-` to the className, along with the `translate-x`/`translate-y`, `opacity` and `visible`/`invisible` values for the shown and hidden states. See the small tooltip for example.
- The `aria-describedby` attribute on the button enhances accessibility by associating the tooltip content with the button for screen readers.

#### Props
- `children`: **ReactNode**
  - The content (usually a button or icon) that triggers the tooltip.
- `message`: **string**
  - The text message displayed inside the tooltip.

#### Example
```jsx
import Tooltip from './Tooltip';

<Tooltip message="Tooltip message">
  Hover over me
</Tooltip>
