### RadioCheck Component
The `RadioCheck` component provides a group of radio buttons for selecting options. It's ideal for forms where a user needs to choose one option from a set.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- The component dynamically generates radio buttons based on the provided `options` array.
- Accessibility is enhanced with labels and appropriate ARIA attributes.
- The radio buttons are styled for a modern look and feel, with custom SVG checkmarks.
- The component handles scenarios where no options are provided by displaying default options and disabling the input.

#### Props
- `label`: **string**
  - The label for the radio button group.
- `options`: **String Array**
  - An array of options for the radio buttons. If no options are provided, the radio buttons are disabled by default.
- `disabled`: **boolean**
  - A boolean to enable or disable the radio buttons.
- `onSubmit`: **function**
  - A callback function that is called when the submit button is clicked.

#### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import RadioCheck from './RadioCheck';

const options = ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"];

const handleSubmit = (selected) => {
    console.log("Selected option:", selected);
};

<Radio
    label="Choose an option"
    options={options}
    onSubmit={handleSubmit}
/>
```
