### Switch Component
The `Switch` component is a toggleable interface element, commonly used as an alternative to a checkbox. It's ideal for scenarios where a user needs to choose between two mutually exclusive options, like enabling/disabling a setting.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- The component mimics a switch control, allowing users to toggle between an on/off state.
- It maintains an internal state to track whether it's checked or not, and this state can be manipulated through user interaction.
- Accessibility is considered with appropriate roles and ARIA attributes. The `role="switch"` and `aria-checked` attributes make it clear to screen reader users that it's a switch control with a toggleable state.
- The `Switch` component also supports being disabled, preventing user interaction in certain conditions.

#### Props
- `label`: **string**
  - The label associated with the switch, describing its purpose.
- `disabled`: **boolean**
  - Determines if the switch is interactable. When `true`, the switch is disabled. Default is false.
- `checked`: **boolean**
  - The initial state of the switch, either checked `true` or unchecked `false`.
- `onChange`: **function**
  - A callback function that is called with the new state when the switch is toggled.

#### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Switch from './Switch';

<Switch
  label="Enable Dark Mode"
  disabled={false}
  checked={true}
  onChange={(value) => console.log('Switch is now:', value)}
/>
