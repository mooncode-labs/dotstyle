### DatePicker Component
The `DatePicker` component is a simple yet effective tool for incorporating date selection functionality into your application. It provides a simple user interface for picking dates, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- Editing its appearance is as simple as changing the 'input' style from your dotstyle Tailwind CSS/JS classes and/or editing the jsx.
- The `DatePicker` is primarily used for selecting a date within forms or filters in your application. Its minimalistic design integrates seamlessly with various UI designs.
- This component is equipped with an interactive calendar interface, allowing users to easily select a date.

#### Props
- `selected` : **string**
  - The currently selected date. Dates should be passed in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
- `onChange` : **function**
  - Event handler for the date change. It's triggered when a user selects a date from the calendar interface.

#### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import DatePicker from './DatePicker';

const handleToastData = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
}

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState('');

  return (
    <DatePicker 
      selected={date} //or selected="2024-01-31" for example
      onChange={handleToastData}
    />
  );
}
