### Table Component
The `Table` component is a responsive and styled table layout suitable for displaying tabular data. This component is ideal for financial or personal data representation, offering a clear, concise view across different screen sizes.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- The component is structured to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes with a particular focus on smaller screens.
- Table headers (`<th>`) provide semantic meaning and improve accessibility, ensuring that screen readers can interpret the table correctly.
- The use of classes like `hidden sm:block` allows for conditional rendering of table columns based on screen size, enhancing the mobile viewing experience.

#### Structure
- The table is wrapped in a div with a `flex` layout to ensure it adapts responsively to the container.
- The `<thead>` section uses classes for styling, including text size and background color.
- The `<tbody>` section contains individual rows (`<tr>`) for each data entry.
- Each table cell (`<td>`) is styled consistently for readability.

#### Example
```jsx
import Table from './Table';

<Table />
