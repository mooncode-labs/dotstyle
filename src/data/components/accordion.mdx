### Accordion Component
The `Accordion` component is a versatile UI element used to display collapsible content panels. It's useful for FAQs, content organization, and improving page navigation.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- The Accordion component is ideal for hiding data until clicked by the user.
- The aria-expanded attribute on the button indicates whether the accordion content is expanded or collapsed. The aria-disabled attribute indicates if the accordion is interactable. The content section is marked with role="region" to signify a perceivable section to assistive technologies.

#### Props
- children : **React Component**
  - The content that will be displayed when the accordion is expanded. This can be text, components, or any JSX elements.
- title : **string**
  - A string that represents the title of the accordion. This will always be visible and is used to toggle the accordion.
- defaultActive : **boolean**
  - A boolean that determines if the accordion should be open or closed by default. Defaults to false.
- disabled : **boolean**
  - A boolean that, when true, disables the ability to open or close the accordion. Defaults to false.

#### Example
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

<Accordion
  title="Accordion Title"
  defaultActive={false}
  disabled={false}
>
  This is the content of the accordion.
</Accordion>
