### Alert Component
The `AlertComponent` is designed to display important messages to users in a concise and noticeable format. It's ideal for displaying success messages, warnings, or other crucial information.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- Editing its appearance is as simple as changing the 'cardDefault' style from your dotstyle Tailwind CSS/JS classes and/or editing the jsx. It also uses 'text5' and 'textBody'. The action button is 'btnPrimary'
- The alert is visible by default. It can be dismissed by the user with the close button/icon/action button.
- role="alert": Marks the element as an alert message, ensuring it is promptly announced by screen readers.
- aria-live="assertive": Indicates that the alert should be announced urgently.

#### Props
- title : **string**
  - A string representing the title of the alert. This is typically a short, bold statement.
- message : **string**
  - A string that provides additional details about the alert.

#### Example
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

<AlertComponent
  title="Notification"
  message="You have new updates available."
/>
