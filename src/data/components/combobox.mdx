### Combobox Component
The `Combobox` component is a customizable dropdown menu, ideal for scenarios where users need to click an button from a list. It features a sleek design and is easy to integrate into various parts of an application.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- This component combines a button and a dropdown list, or dropdown list reveal on hover for ease of use. You can mix and match these as shown in the third variant.
- Accessibility features such as `role="combobox"`, `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-haspopup` are implemented for better integration with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- Mouse and keyboard focus events control the visibility of the dropdown, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

#### Props
- `label`: **string**
  - The text displayed on the button that triggers the dropdown.
- `onOptionClick`: **function**
  - A callback function that is called when an option in the dropdown is clicked.

#### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ComboboxDropdown from './ComboboxDropdown';

const options = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'];

<Combobox1
  label="Select an Option"
  onOptionClick={(option) => console.log('Selected:', option)}
/>
