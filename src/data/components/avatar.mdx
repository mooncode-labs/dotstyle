### Avatar Component
The `Avatar` component is a user interface element that combines an avatar image with a user's name and a clickable action. It's ideal for user profiles, comment sections, or any place where you need to display user information alongside an avatar.

#### Usage
- This component displays a user's avatar, with variant for their name or a status badge.
- The avatar's size is customizable through the `height` prop.
- An `onClick` event handler can be attached for additional interactivity, such as opening a user profile or triggering a modal.

#### Props
- `src`: **string**
  - The URL of the avatar image.
- `height`: **string**
  - The height of the avatar image. If not provided, it defaults to "40px".
- `name`: **string**
  - The name of the user to be displayed next to the avatar.
- `onClick`: **function**
  - The function to execute when the avatar is clicked.

#### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import AvatarNamed from './AvatarNamed';

<AvatarNamed
  src="https://placehold.co/100x100"
  height="50px"
  name="John Doe"
  onClick={() => console.log('Avatar Clicked')}
/>
