### Tabs Component
The `Tabs` component is a versatile UI element used for organizing content into different sections, typically displayed as a set of clickable tabs. Users can switch between tabs to view different sets of content without navigating away from the page.

#### Usage and Accessibility
- The component utilizes checkboxes to toggle between different tabs, providing both mouse and keyboard accessibility.
- Each tab is associated with a specific content section, which is displayed when the tab is active.
- Users can interact with tabs by clicking on them or navigating using the keyboard (e.g., using the Tab key to move focus and the Enter key to select a tab).
- The active tab is visually distinguished from inactive tabs, usually by changing its appearance, such as background color or font weight.

#### Props
- `tabs`: **Array** of **Objects**
  - An array of objects representing individual tabs. Each object should have the following properties:
    - `label`: **string** - The text displayed on the tab button.
    - `value`: **string** - Unique identifier for the tab.
    - `content`: **string** - The text content displayed when the tab is active.

#### Example
```jsx
import Tab from './Tab';

const tabs = [
  {
    label: 'Sun',
    value: 'sun',
    content:
      'The sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light and infrared radiation.'
  },
  {
    label: 'Moon',
    value: 'moon',
    content:
      'The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth as its only natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System, and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits.'
  },
  {
    label: 'Earth',
    value: 'earth',
    content:
      'Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of Earth\'s surface is land, consisting of continents and islands.'
  }
];
