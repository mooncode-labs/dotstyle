### Rich Text Editor Component
The `Editor` component is a responsive and styled text editor suitable for creating rich text. This is ideal in apps where you need to allow users to create customised and formattable text.

### Usage
  - This component is utilising react quill. You will need to install this dependency.

  1. Please install react quill for this component to work.
  `npm i react-quill`
  2. You will notice the editor will have a slightly different styling. To make it look exactly like our style, please paste the following code into your css file.
  ```css
    .ql-toolbar{
    border: 0 !important;
    border-radius: 3px;
    background: rgb(229, 229, 229);
    }
    .ql-container{
      border: 0 !important;
      color: black !important;
    }
  ```
For further customisation, see react quill [docs](https://quilljs.com/docs/quickstart/)

#### Structure
- The editor header contains your editor tools to format text. The options can be edited by changing the `modules` object.
- The editor is configured to accept images, links and video as well.

#### Example
```jsx
import Editor from './Editor';

<Editor />
