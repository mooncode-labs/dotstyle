### Skeleton Component
The `Skeleton` component is a versatile placeholder used to enhance the user experience during data loading phases. It simulates the layout of the content that is loading, providing a smooth visual cue to indicate data fetching or processing.

#### Usage
- This component is ideal for displaying a placeholder while waiting for content to load, thereby improving the perceived performance of the application.
- It's typically used in scenarios where data fetches might lead to a delay in rendering actual content, such as retrieving user information or loading a list of items.
- The component includes animated elements that mimic the layout of a typical card, image or text.

#### Structure
- The entire card and its elements have a 'pulse' animation, which creates a visually appealing loading effect.

#### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import SkeletonCard from './SkeletonCard';

const ContentComponent = () => {
  const [content, setContent] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  // Simulating a data fetch
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setContent({ title: "Loaded Content", description: "This is the description of the loaded content." });
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 3000); // 3 seconds delay
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? (
        <SkeletonCard />
      ) : (
        <div className="cardDefault">
          <h2>{content.title}</h2>
          <p>{content.description}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ContentComponent;
