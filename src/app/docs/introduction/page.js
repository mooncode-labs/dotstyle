            <DocsSection title={'How does it work'}>
                <p className='textP'>One of the issues with building components can be the design process itself,
                    especially achieving consistent design. While design systems try to achieve this, they are rarely
                    code based and the translation from design to code can be tough for developers. This is the issue we
                    aim to solve.</p>
                <p>In short, this app currently has 3 features:</p>
                <div className="flex flex-col ml-4">
                    <li>Our premade components</li>
                    <span className="textMute">For example: alerts, modals, toasts, navbars...</span>
                    <span className="textMute">You can browse our components from the left nav and copy their code to add them to your site</span>
                </div>
                <div className="flex flex-col ml-4">
                    <li>Create Design Systems with basic components</li>
                    <span className="textMute">Design systems contain input, buttons, cards, text variants, icons and badges and divs. Plus all their applicable states like disabled, hover, invalid...</span>
                    <span className="textMute">A default set is used in our components, but you can style your own to fit your app.</span>
                </div>
                <div className="flex flex-col ml-4">
                    <li>Component Builder</li>
                    <span className="textMute">Type code, use AI chat, or upload an image to create custom components in our build tool.</span>
                    <span className="textMute">The code can then be copied into your app. The build tool will also render any custom classes you have made in your design system.</span>
                </div>

                <p>With these base components we encourage you to build your own component libary, this way you know
                    what happens in all your components, how to style each one, and make it truly yours.
                    If not, our premade components feature a sleek, modern and animated
                    default design, all free to use.</p>
                <h4 className="siteText4">Don't know Tailwind?</h4>
                <p>Don't worry! We have predefined selectors to help you change colors, borders etc. without writing any
                    Tailwind. You will see the Tailwind code update live, hopefully learning some Tailwind along the way
                    ðŸ˜‰.</p>

            <DocsSection title={'Why Tailwind?'}>
                <p className='textP'>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to streamline and simplify the process of styling web applications. Tailwind CSS simplifies styling by providing a set of pre-defined utility classes that directly apply styles to HTML elements.</p>
                <p>While some may find it restrictive, the pre-defined classlist nature of Tailwind actually encourages a more consistent style throughout your app, rather that falling into the trap of having extremely specifc or one-case CSS values that may occur with traditional CSS styling.</p>
                <p>Always remember, a great website is one that is consistent throughout, easy for your users to view and navigate, and one which is accessible to all types of users. Tailwind helps you achieve this.</p>

                    <BreezeAccordion title='Which frameworks can I use this for?' id={1}>
                        Our premade components are created with React,
                        but our design systems are pure Tailwind @apply styles, so it is not locked to any framework.
                        The Build tool, while written in react syntax, has the options to copy the code as React, HTML with your classnames, or HTML with raw Tailwind.
                    </BreezeAccordion>
                    <BreezeAccordion title='Is there any licensing or royalties to use this in my project?' id={2}>
                        Nope! All our components, premium Blocks, AI generated components, and Themes are free to use in personal or commercial projects. No attribution required.
                    </BreezeAccordion>
                    <BreezeAccordion title='Do the components support TypeScript?' id={3}>
                        As of now, all our premade components are written in JavaScript. We may add TypeScript versions in the future, given enough demand or support from the community.
                        Saying this, conversion to TypeScript should be fairly easy, as our components are not complex. GPT can convert then quite easily ðŸ˜‰.
                    </BreezeAccordion>
                    <BreezeAccordion title='Will it clash with my CSS?' id={4}>
                        No! Unless you have a class with the same name, our styles will not clash with your CSS. If they do, consider adding a prefix to our classes. Please be careful
                        when adding more classes on top of our classes, as you may have duplicated styles.
